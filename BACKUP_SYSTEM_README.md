3. **Restart your development server** to load the environment variables

4. **Credentials will be automatically pre-filled** in the UI form

### Download ZIP Backup
1. Click the blue "Download Complete Project Backup (ZIP)" button
2. Wait for the backup to be created (may take 30-60 seconds for large projects)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Large File Sizes
- The backup includes `node_modules` which can be very large
- This is intentional to ensure complete project preservation
- Download may take 30-60 seconds depending on project size

### Google Drive Upload Issues
- **Authentication Failed**: 
  - Verify your API credentials are correct in `.env.local` or form fields
  - Check that Google Drive API is enabled in your Google Cloud project
  - Ensure refresh token is valid and not expired
  - Verify OAuth consent screen is properly configured
  - Check redirect URI matches: `https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground`

- **Permission Issues**:
  - Ensure you have the correct scopes: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`
  - Check folder ID if specified (must be accessible by your account)
  - Verify your OAuth token has the required Google Drive permissions

- **Environment Variable Issues**:
  - Ensure `.env.local` file exists in project root
  - Verify environment variables are set correctly (no extra spaces)
  - Restart development server after creating/modifying `.env.local`
  - Check that `.env.local` is not committed to version control

### Memory Issues
- For very large projects, the system creates the ZIP in memory
- If you encounter memory issues, consider excluding some large directories temporarily

### Common Error Messages
- **"Missing required Google Drive credentials"**: Check your `.env.local` file or form inputs
- **"Invalid or expired refresh token"**: Generate a new refresh token using OAuth playground
- **"Insufficient permissions"**: Verify your OAuth scopes include drive.file access
